# Scala ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This exception occurs when you try to access an element in an array or list using an index that is out of bounds.  This example shows how to reproduce the error and how to avoid it.

The `bug.scala` file contains code that will throw the exception. The `bugSolution.scala` file shows a corrected version.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile and run the code using the Scala compiler.

For example:
```bash
scala bug.scala
```

This will print the error message.
Then run
```bash
scala bugSolution.scala
```
This will demonstrate the corrected solution.
